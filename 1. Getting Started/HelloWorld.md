## Print

```print()``` is a python function, it receives a piece of text (a string) and outputs it to the terminal, showing it to the user.

Every Python function should start with its name followed by parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis you should write the string you want to display.

In Python, strings must start and end with quotes, ```"``` or ```'```.


## Why Hello, World!

“Hello, World!” is traditionally the first program people write when learning a new programming language. Its purpose is simple: it lets you check that your programming environment is working correctly and shows you how to write and run code.

Its origin comes from an example program in the 1978 book ***The C Programming Language***.
