# How do Programming Languages Work

A programming language is a way for humans to give instructions to a computer. It uses a set of rules and words that the computer can understand, allowing us to tell it what to do step by step.

But how does someone *create* a programming language? And how can a computer understand so many different languages?

There are 3 main types of programming languages: compiled, interpreted and a mixture of both.

## Compiled Programming Languages

In compiled languages, the code is processed by a **compiler** and translated into an executable file that the operating system can understand and run. Example: C++

## Interpreted Programming Languages

In interpreted languages, the code is read and executed by an **interpreter** line by line, without first being translated into a separate executable file. Example: Python
