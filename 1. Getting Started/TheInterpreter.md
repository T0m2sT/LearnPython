# The Interpreter

You can access the python interpreter by either writing ```py``` on your terminal or opening the python 3.12 executable. You can find it by searching ```python``` on your windows search bar:

</p>

After opening it up this is what you will see:

```
Python 3.12.6 (tags/v3.12.6:a4a2d2b, Sep  6 2024, 20:11:23) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You can write Python code directly in the interpreter, just like you would in a Python file.

For example, you can use it as a simple calculator:

```
Python 3.12.6 (tags/v3.12.6:a4a2d2b, Sep  6 2024, 20:11:23) [MSC v.1940 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> 10 / 2
5.0
>>> 4 * 7
28
```

You can exit the interpreter by writing:

```
>>> exit()
```
