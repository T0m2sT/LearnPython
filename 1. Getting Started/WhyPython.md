# Why Python

Python is a popular interpreted programming language, created in 1991 Guido van Rossum.

Python was chosen because it is both powerful and easy to learn. It has a simple syntax, which makes it easy to read and write. Python is a high-level language, meaning you don’t need to worry about many low-level, *under-the-hood* details. It is also a general-purpose language, making it great for solving a wide variety of problems.
