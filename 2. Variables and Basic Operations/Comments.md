# Comments

Comments are pieces of text in your code that are meant for you and other people to help explain what the code does. They are completely ignored by Python when the program runs. So far, you have already seen a few comments in the examples, mainly used to show the output of the ```print()``` function.

```py
# Here is an example of a comment

# Comments do nothing and only serve as a way to explain the code

# You can also use comments as reminders for yourself
# Like this:

# TODO: fix this code
hello_world("print")
```

You can use comments to temporarily remove a part of your code without deleting it.

```py
# Not working
#hello_world("print")
```
