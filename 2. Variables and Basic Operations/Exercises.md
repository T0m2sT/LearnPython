## 1. Length Printer

Given a string, print its length.

| Input        | Output |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Banana       | 6      |
| Hello world! | 12     |

## 2. Divider

Given two positive numbers, divide them and round the result to 2 decimal places.

> Note: You can use the second parameter of the ```round()``` function to specify how many decimal places to keep.
> For example: ```round(5.579, 2)``` rounds the number to 2 decimal places.

## 3. Average Calculator

Given three numbers, print their average rounded to 1 decimal place.

## 4. Hypotenuse Calculator

Given the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, make a hypotenuse calculator. Round the result to 3 decimal places.

> Note: Taking the square root of a number is the same as raising it to the power of **0.5**.

## 8. Change

You are a cashier. Given an amount of change to give to a customer, write a Python program that calculates how many banknotes of each value are needed.

The available banknotes are 50€, 20€, 10€, and 5€.

Your program should output the number of banknotes in the following format: ```# 50 / # 20 / # 10 / # 5```

Replace each ```#``` with the number of banknotes of that value.

Extra - In case banknotes are not sufficient, print the remaining change.

Example:

|     Input    |           Output         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
|      245     |  50 / 2 20 / 0 10 / 1 5  |
|      356     | 7 50 / 0 20 / 0 10 / 1 5 |
|   (cont.)    |   Remaining change: 1    |

## 9. Future Time

It is currently 18:07. If you go to sleep now, and you are given the number of hours and minutes you will sleep for, write a Python program that calculates and displays the time shown on the clock when you wake up.

Example:

|     Input    |             Output          |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
|     04:20    |     Wake-Up time: 22:27     |
|     03:63    |     Wake-Up time: 22:10     |
|     27:45    |     Wake-Up time: 21:52     |
|   (cont.)    |   Not the same day, 1 ...   |
|   (cont.)    |   day(s) after you slept.   |
