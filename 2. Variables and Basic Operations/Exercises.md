## 1. Length Printer

Given a string, print its length.

| Input        | Output |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Banana       | 6      |
| Hello world! | 12     |

## 2. Divider

Given two positive numbers, divide them and round the result to 2 decimal places.

> Note: You can use the second parameter of the ```round()``` function to specify how many decimal places to keep.
> For example: ```round(5.579, 2)``` rounds the number to 2 decimal places.

## 4. Hypotenuse Calculator

Given the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, make a hypotenuse calculator. Round the result to 3 decimal places.

> Note: Taking the square root of a number is the same as raising it to the power of **0.5**.

## 8. Change

You are a cashier. Given an amount of change to give to a customer, write a Python program that calculates how many banknotes of each value are needed.

The available banknotes are 50€, 20€, 10€, and 5€.

Your program should output the number of banknotes in the following format: ```#50 #20 #10 #5```

Replace each ```#``` with the number of banknotes of that value.

## 9. Future Time

It is currently 18:07. If you go to sleep now, and you are given the number of hours and minutes you will sleep for, write a Python program that calculates and displays the time shown on the clock when you wake up.
